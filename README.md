# How to layout your Streamlit app

In this tutorial, we're going to use the following commands to layout our Streamlit app:
- `st.set_page_config(layout="wide")` - Displays the contents of the app in wide mode (otherwise by default, the contents are encapsulated in a fixed width box.
- `st.sidebar` - Places the widgets or text/image displays in the sidebar.
- `st.expander` - Places text/image displays inside a collapsible container box.
- `st.columns` - Creates a tabular space (or column) within which contents can be placed inside.
